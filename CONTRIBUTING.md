# Contributing Guidelines

## Please follow these rules: 
* Open or claim an Issue before contributing. It helps keep track of the work and prevents many people working on the same thing. 
* Add comments where necessary
* KISS - Keep It Simple, Supporter! Fancy code is fun, but simple code is easy to read and easy to maintain. Always favour simplicity. 
* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself! Why do in many lines of code... what you could do with a few well placed CSS classes. 

## How to contribute: 
* Open or claim an Issue
* Fork the repository
* Clone to your local (git clone https://github.com/yourUserName/Rubys-Cupcakes.git)
* Create a new branch (git checkout -b branchName)
* Make code changes
* Get ready for commit (git add .)
* Commit your changes with a concise, descriptive message (git commit -m "Very concise message")
* Push your changes (git push)
* Create a Pull Request, make sure you reference the Issue # and describe your work
